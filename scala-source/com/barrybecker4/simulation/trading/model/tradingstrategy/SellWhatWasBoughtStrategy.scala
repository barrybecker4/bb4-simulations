/**
  * This is the strategy suggested by John Roh.
  * The idea is to sell what was bought when the market increases by some threshold, and buy a fixed amount on dips
  *
  * Example
  * startingTotal = 100,000
  * fixedPurchasePercent = 5%
  * fixedPurchaseAmount = 5000
  * startingInvestmentPercent = 10%
  * invested = 10,000 (initially)
  *
  * If the market goes up, we do nothing - we never sell the initial investment
  * If the market goes down by lossChangePercent, then buy fixedPurchaseAmount.
  * If the market again goes down by lossChangePercent more, then buy fixedPurchaseAmount.
  * Remember these buy transactions
  * If the market ever increases gainChangePercent higher than one of those purchases, then sell it.
  * Buy whenever the marked drops by lossChangePercent from last transaction.
  *
