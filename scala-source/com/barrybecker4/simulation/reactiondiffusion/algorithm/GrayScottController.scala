/**
  * Makes the GrayScott algorithm run concurrently if setParallelized is set to true.
  * Primary purpose of this class is to handle breaking the algorithm up into concurrent worker threads.
  *
  * Here are some parallelism results using my Core2Duo 6400 (and later i7 2600k) using fixed size.
  * Without parallelism  8.62 fps
  * With parallelism (but not borders) 10.16 fps
  * With parallelism (and borders in sep thread) 10.36 fps
  * After more tuning 18 fps (num steps per frame = 10)
  *
  * Using offscreen rendering slowed things by about 10%
  * These numbers are with Hyper-threading off. The difference compared to hyper-threading off is barely 10%.
  *
  *                      pr/ns   pr/sync  npr/ns   npr/synch
  *                      ------- -------  -------  -------
  * parallel calc       | 23.8     21.1     20.9     20.5
  * n-par calc          | 19.0     17.1              17.0
  * n-par calc/offscreen|                   12.8     12.9
  * par calc/offscreen  | 17.2     14.2     14.3     14.1
  *
  * pr/ns : parallel rendering/ not synchronized
  * npr/ns : no parallel rendering/ no synchronization.
  * Parallel rendering without synchronization is fast, but has bad rendering artifacts.
  *
  * Made some more improvements
  *   - upgraded to ci7 2600k with 4 cores and 8 threads (hyper-threaded).
  *   - fixed a bug in Model.commit where I was using arrayCopy instead of just a pointer swap.
  *   - Modified parallel rendering code so that I compute images and write them quickly
  * rather than drawing individual points which needed to be synchronized (set color, then draw point)
  * Notes
  *   - The difference between onscreen and offscreen rendering seems negligible.
  *   - Getting really great CPU utilization of cores - somewhere around 85%.
  *   - The temperature of the CPU really heats up. Saw max temp of 76C.
  *
  *                         par rend           non-par rendering
  *                         ------------       --------------
  * parallel calc       |   180 fps             78 fps
  * n-par calc          |   102 fps             66 fps
  *
  * For larger rectangle than fixed, the performance increases seem even better
  *
  *                         par rend           non-par rendering
  *                         ------------       --------------
  * parallel calc       |   19.5 fps            8.1 fps
  * n-par calc          |   13.2 fps            6.8 fps

  * @param initialWidth  width of computational space.
