/**
 * This is the strategy suggested by John Roh.
 * The idea is to sell what was bought when the market increases by some threshold, and buy a fixed amount on dips
 *
 * Example
 *  startingTotal = 100,000
 *  fixedPurchasePercent = 5%
 *  fixedPurchaseAmount = 5000
 *  startingInvestmentPercent = 10%
 *  invested = 10,000 (initially)
 *
 *  If the market goes up, we do nothing - we never sell the initial investment
 *  If the market goes down by lossChangePercent, then buy fixedPurchaseAmount.
 *  If the market again goes down by lossChangePercent more, then buy fixedPurchaseAmount.
 *  Remember these buy transactions
 *  If the market ever increases gainChangePercent higher than one of those purchases, then sell it.
 *  Buy whenever the marked drops by lossChangePercent from last transaction.
